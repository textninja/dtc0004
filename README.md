# Daily Tech Challenge #4

For this challenge, I needed to learn React Native well enough to create a
simple meditation timer. I succeeded in this venture; the final product is in
the meditationtimer folder. It's a timer that counts down from 10 minutes and
plays a bell sound when it begins and ends.

I used the following to build it:

 - Expo
 - expo-av
 - React Navigation (DarkTheme, Native Stack)
 - &lt;TouchableOpacity/&gt;
 - &lt;Text/&gt;

In addition to the main app, various scraps and subcomponents are in the
practice folder. These are mostly expo snacks I created while following along
with the reactnative.dev docs.
